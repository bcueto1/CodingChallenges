TripleLift Coding Challenge

This contains all the necessary problems and test cases for the TripleLift Coding Challenge. Problem 1
is in TripleLift.java, Problem 2 is in TripleLiftianNumbers.java, and Problem 3 is in PermuttedSubstrings.java.
There are test cases for Problem 1, 2 and 3 that show that everything is working perfectly.  There was no
specification about whether the programs/methods should have a main, but I assumed there should be for 
Problem 1, so there is a main there. Everything should be working fine.  Testing was done using JUnit.

/-------- Note on Problem 3. ----------/
There was no specification as to what characters the string was supposed to handle, so I just assumed
alphabetical characters was to just be tested.  My method runs in O(n) time, which is the length
of the big string.  However, if other ascii characters needed to be tested, then the program can easily be
changed such that the hashmap used has values for all other ascii characters and their associated primes.
